*(The gif you can see above was a concept for the main menu of a game I made in Unity in mid 2016. I later remade it in Unreal4 at the end of 2017 because I always liked the look. I would love to remake it in Vulkan as soon as I have time to study GPGPU particles. This video is captured from the Unreal Version.)*

## About me
Hi, my name is Michele, but you can call me Scrappy.
I am studying Computer Science at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/).

I have always been passionate about game engines and rendering, so in my free time I am learning the basics of Vulkan ([ScrapEngine](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/ScrapEngine)) and DirectX12 ([DXR](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials)).

I like to help other people to understand concepts I studied and understood, because of this I always encourage to open an Issue to discuss if you don't understand something, I will reply as soon as possible!

Since the end of 2019 I joined [Project Borealis](https://www.projectborealis.com/) as volunteer programmer to help the team creating a fan-made Half-Life game in Unreal Engine, doing mainly Audio Programming, another thing I am passionate about.
