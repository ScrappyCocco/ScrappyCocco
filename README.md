*(The gif you can see above was a concept for the main menu of a game I made in Unity in mid-2016. I later remade it in Unreal4 at the end of 2017 because I always liked the look. This video is captured from the Unreal Version.)*

## About me

Hi, my name is Michele, but you can call me Scrappy.
I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/). I did a final year Internship and "thesis", about [volumetric rendering of medical data](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/StageETesi) (Italian only).

I have always been passionate about game engines and rendering, so in my free time I studied the basics of Vulkan ([ScrapEngine](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/ScrapEngine)) and DirectX12 ([DXR](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/DirectX-DXR-Tutorials)).

I like to help other people to understand concepts I studied and understood, because of this I always encourage to open an Issue if you have a question or if you want to discuss something you don't understood, I will reply as soon as possible!

Since the end of 2019 I joined [Project Borealis](https://www.projectborealis.com/) as volunteer programmer to help the team creating a fan-made Half-Life game in Unreal Engine, doing mainly Audio Programming, another thing I am passionate about.

I am currently working full time as Game programmer, while I keep helping Project Borealis in my spare time, doing much more than just Audio Programming.
