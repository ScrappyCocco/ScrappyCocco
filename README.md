# Hi, I am Michele ðŸŽ®

Hi, my name is Michele, but you can call me Scrappy.
I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/). I did a final year internship and "thesis", about [volumetric rendering of medical data](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/StageETesi) (Italian only).

I have always been passionate about game development and game engines, so in my free time during university, I studied the basics of Vulkan ([ScrapEngine](https://github.com/ScrappyCocco/ScrapEngine)). I like to help and mentor other people when I can, and because of this I always encourage to open an issue if you have a question or if you want to discuss something you don't understood, I will reply as soon as possible!

At the end of 2019 I joined [Project Borealis](https://www.projectborealis.com/) as volunteer programmer to help the team creating a fan-made Half-Life game in Unreal Engine, which I did for a couple of years. 

I am currently working full time as Online (Game) Programmer developing racing games.
